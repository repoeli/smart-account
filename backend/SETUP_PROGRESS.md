## 📝 Important Note About PostgreSQL Logs

The PostgreSQL logs you saw showing connection errors were from **earlier failed attempts** (around 15:17-15:35) when the database configuration was incorrect. The successful migrations happened later at 15:48, and since then the database has been working perfectly. The logs show:

- **15:17-15:35**: Failed connection attempts (resolved)
- **15:48**: Successful migrations applied
- **Current**: Database fully operational with all tables and proper schema
